  <h1>Object Destructuring</h1>

  <h3> Don't worry too much about the javascript and console logs in this one, I will put them but I'm going to try to
    explain it in the HTML. </h3>

  OK, so let's say we have an object called bigMike. It will look like this:
<br>
let bigMike = <br> 

  {  <br>
  age: 28, <br>
  swag: 'unlimited', <br>
  strengths: ['really cool', 'has a tattoo', 'good listener'] <br>
  }
  <br>
  <br>
Well, if we wanted to go and set a variable to be equal to each value, we would have to do this: <br>
<br>
let age = bigMike.age <br>
let swag = bigMike.swag <br>
let strengths = bigMike.strengths <br>
<br>

But that's the old, boring way to do it. It also takes more lines of code and isn't all that convenient.

<br>

<br>



With object destructuring, we can set new variables to be equal to any value within the key value pairs by saying this: <br>
<br>

let { age, swag, strengths } = bigMike <br>

<br>

We now have a variable called age equal to 28, 
<br> a variable called swag equal to unlimited,
<br> and a variable called
strengths equal to ['really cool', 'has a tattoo', 'good listener']. <br>
<br>



Although it looks like we are setting up our bigMike object to be something different, we're actually not. if you console log your object after destructuring it, it will look the same. 

<br>

check the Javascript and your console log on this file to see this example played out if you'd like. <br>

  <h1>Destructuring in .then statements, and some other objects </h1>

<br>
  <p>So while the last example is useful it's probably not the most common way you will see destructuring. You can destructure any object including the the ones you would see after a .then statement. For this example let's use axios and query the pokemon api since we've done that before. </p>

  <br>

  <p>
    Our axios request would normally look like this: 

    <br>
    axios.get('https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/kangaskhan')
    <br>
    <span style="background-color: lightcoral;">.then (res => {</span>
      <br>
    console.log(res.data)
    <br>
    let pokemon = res.data
    <br>
    })
    <br>

    <p>
      Well, we know that res is an object with a KEY of data on it, and a bunch of stuff inside of that VALUE. If we just console logged res, it would look something like this: 

      <br>
      { <br>
        data: a whole bunch of stuff <br>
      } <br>

      Since we know we only want the DATA key from the RES object, we can destructure our query to look like this: 

      <br>
      axios.get('https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/kangaskhan')
      <br>
      <span style="background-color: lightcoral;"> .then (({data}) => { </span>
      <br>
      console.log(data)
      <br>
      let pokemon = data
      <br>
      })
      <br>
      <br>
    Maybe you are wondering, why the parentheses? Shouldn't it just look like this? 
    <br>
    <br>
    axios.get('https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/kangaskhan')
    <br>
    <span style = "background-color: lightcoral;">.then ({data} => { </span>  
      <br>
    </p>
    well, this is just one of those weird javascript syntax things. this just happens to be the way it's written. 
  </p>
<br>
Ok, one last thing here. 
<br>
<br>
we can actually use a colon after the object we destructured to rename it. So, so far we have taken ONLY the data KEY and VALUE from res, but it is still called data. What we can do here is this: 
<br>
axios.get('https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/kangaskhan')
<br>
<span style="background-color: lightcoral;">.then (({data: pokemon}) => { </span>
<br>
We now have a variable called pokemon that is equal to res.data.
<br>
Hopefully this helped you out a bit on object destructuring, you can always reach out to me if you have any more questions. :)
