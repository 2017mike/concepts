//now we are taking the array that we pulled down, changed, and sending it back to localStorage as myStoredArray. 
//localStorage takes in two parameters when you set an item: the name of the item, which is the string 'myStoredArray', and the item itself. In our case, the item itself is the stringified version of our updated array. 
//Now it will show up in localStorage as a key-value pair:  ('myStoredArray': myStoredArray) 
//Take a look in your local Storage to see what I am talking about. 


//to look at your localStorage, go to the Application tab inside of your developer tools. 


//here we are looping through the array that we pulled down and added an item to. This will render our updated array to the page.

//hopefully this helps with your localStorage. To clear out your localStorage go to your console and type localStorage.clear().
